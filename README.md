Setting Up Jupyter Notebook
1. Install Python
Make sure Python is installed on your system (version 3.8+ recommended).

You can download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Verify installation:

python --version

2. Install Jupyter Notebook
Use pip to install:

pip install notebook

Or, if you are using Anaconda (recommended for data projects), Jupyter comes pre-installed.


3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder:

cd path/to/your/project

Start Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

A browser window will open with the Jupyter interface.

4. Create a New Notebook
Click New → Python 3 to create a new notebook.

You can now start writing Python code in cells.

5. Install Required Libraries in Notebook
You can install libraries directly from a notebook cell:

!pip install requests beautifulsoup4 gspread oauth2client gspread-formatting

Built-in libraries like time and datetime do not need installation.

6. Save and Run
Save your notebook using File → Save As.

Run a cell by pressing Shift + Enter.
